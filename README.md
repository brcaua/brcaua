After 5 years, many different IT environments, and experiences, I can say that I'm more than happy and proud of doing what I do. Being able to build software, join a team, learn and share knowledge, and provide solutions to all kinds of requirements really represents something meaningful in my professional career.

For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been focusing my efforts on diving deep into the knowledge required to successfully embrace a technical leadership role. My daily routine includes lots of coding, reading, and really lovely discussions with fellow colleagues. 

I started this journey as a 14-year-old kid figuring out which career to pursue and here I am, at 20, motivated, always looking for new challenges, and ready for what's next.
