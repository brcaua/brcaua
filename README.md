## "Always leave the code better than you found it", Uncle Bob.

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in delivering high-quality Front-end and Back-end solutions with more than 45 million users reached.

I believe that society changes according to technological innovations and not the other way around. That's why I'm inspired by the potential for social transformation that technology has and the speed with which digital innovations happen.

Enthusiastic about technology, I'm passionate about learning new technologies and take new challenges. My current stack is based on, but not limited to, React and Node.js monoliths (REST API, GraphQL, Postgres).
